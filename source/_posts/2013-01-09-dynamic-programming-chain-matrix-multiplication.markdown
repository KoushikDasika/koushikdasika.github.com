        We will use this table to keep track of the cost of multiplying matricies.
        Notice that the diagonals are all 0; its because we won't be multiplying a matrix
        by itself.  The boxes with hyphens will be ignored because matrix multiplication works
        from left to right, not the other way around.  Element Z<sub>a,b</sub> in the table
        will be the cost of multiplying all the matricies between a and b.  Getting the 
        top right corner box will give us our final answer.

  The purpose of this post is to show a fully worked out example
  of Chain Matrix Multiplication using dynamic programming, a fancy
  term for breaking a big problem down into subproblems.
</p>
<p>
  There are multiple sources online with great proofs, source code,
  and explaination of those proofs, but I did not find an example problem that
  I felt was easy to understand and follow.
  I hope that the proofs become much easier to understand having seen this problem.

  You may be wondering "What is my motivation for doing this problem using <em>Dynamic Programming</em> 
  when I could just as easily multiply the matricies in order and be done with it?".  Well, suppose that 
  the matricies are really big; as in, each matrix was a couple of hundred columns and rows.  
  Ordinary matrix multiplication is an Î˜(n<sup>3</sup>) operation, so it will take many operations.  
  It just so happens that the order in which you multiply matricies makes a huge difference in the number of 
  calculations you have to do.  That's why we look for the optimal order (technical term is factorization)  of multiplication.
