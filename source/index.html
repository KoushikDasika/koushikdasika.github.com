Hi! My name is <strong> Koushik Dasika </strong>.  Welcome to my blog!
<br />
About me:
<p>
I graduated from Rutgers University with a
degree in math and computer science.  I love to write code,
solve problems, and learn new things everyday.  I primarily
do Ruby on Rails development.  My super power is being able to write code;
I can solve real world problems and create new things.
</p>

<br />

<ul> Why you should hire me:

</ul>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>
In 10 years, I plan to have my own startup.
My passion is in education.  I know that websites like Coursera and Udemy are changing the way colleges are
distributing knowledge, but I feel that the quality of textbooks is lacking.  I have been a tutor
for the past 2 years, led recitations for CS111 at Rutgers for 2 semesters,
and have taught students from middle school level to Masters students in math or computer science.
I found that all of my students were very bright people, but they were having difficulty
understanding concepts because the topics were not presented to them in an easy to understand fashion.  I attribute
this problem to the fact that textbooks are written by authors who have an indepth understanding of their subject;
the authors should ideally write their textbooks as if they themselves were learning the topic for the first time.
So towards that end, I have written my own 150 page Calculus I and II textbook which I use when I am tutoring students.  I also
have made my own tutoring website, NowTutor.Me, in March 2012.  More recently, I made another website with a few friends
called LearnMeSomething (and made a blog post about it) for Rails Rumble 2012.  We plan on expanding LearnMeSomething
into an MVP.
